	<div class="left-div" style="width: 50%; float: left;">
		<h2>GOTO ANYTHING</h2>
		<p>Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.</p>
		<p>Triggered with Ctrl+P, it is possible to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Type part of a file name to open it.</li>
			<li>Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take you to line 100 of the same file.</p>
		<h2>MULTIPLE SELECTIONS</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="right-div" style="width: 50%; float: right;">
		<h2>GOTO DEFINITION</h2>
		<p>Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function. This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol</li>
			<li>Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol</li>
			<li>The Goto Symbol in Project functionality</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their needs.</p>
		<h2>COMMAND PALETTE</h2>
