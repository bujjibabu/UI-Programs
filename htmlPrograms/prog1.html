    <h2>GOTO ANYTHING</h2>
    <p>Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.</p>
    <p>Triggered with Ctrl+P, it is possible to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Triggered with Ctrl+P, it is possible to:</li>
      <li>Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take you to line 100 of the same file.</p>
    <h2>MULTIPLE SELECTIONS</h2>
    <p>Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.</p>
    <p>Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+L to split the selection into lines and Ctrl+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the <a href="xxx">Column Selection</a> documentation.</p>

    <h2>GOTO DEFINITION</h2>
    <p>Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function. This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol</li>
      <li>Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol</li>
      <li>The Goto Symbol in Project functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their needs.</p>
    <h2>COMMAND PALETTE</h2>
    <p>The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key bindings.</p>
