        <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="design-section">
        <p>In 2002, before we were known as 3Sixty Integrated, CEO Joseph Ndesandjo founded DHS Security to help protect commercial and residential clients and their assets.</p>
        <p>After a few years and several thousand satisfied clients, the team decided to focus exclusively on what we do best for our clients --</p>
        <p>custom engineer-designed, IT-compatible security system installation and integration for enterprise clients, with proper support and training.</p>
        <P>In 2008, DHS sold off its residential business and rebranded as 3Sixty Integrated.</P>
        <p>3Sixty is now a one-stop shop for enterprise security systems in the State of Texas, and a trusted partner for many clients in the US military, K-12 ISD's (Independent School Districts), higher education, healthcare, and enterprise-level business.</p>

			<li>Keep your security professionals fully trained, prepared, and in control of any security incident ... no more scrambling because only one person knows all of the system, and maybe they're out sick the next time something goes wrong.</li>
