		<p><b>DESIGN THAT WORKS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Know what you want to accomplish with your security, but not how to get there?</li>
			<li>Need a security system that accommodates your procedures and processes, not the other way around?</li>
			<li>Want your security system(s) to be easy to manage, with full control of everything from a single interface that's easy to understand and use?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When it comes to security, unprofessional design is all-but-guaranteed to end in disaster.</p>
	</div>
	<hr class="horizontal-line">
	<div class="design-section">
		<p><b>WHETHER IT'S:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Missing video footage or a report that's missing critical information</li>
			<li>Intrusion detection or a communications system that fails to alert the right people</li>
			<li>Access control that lets the wrong people in</li>
			<li>Staff who can barely keep up with a poorly-designed system that's difficult and time-consuming to use</li>
			<li>Or unexpected blind spots in your security coverage...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can't afford second-rate design when it comes to security.</p>
		<p>3Sixty's design service ensures that your security system gives you complete control and convenience, without compromise.</p>

		<p><b>THE CUSTOM DESIGN SECRET</b></p>
		<p>There's a dirty secret in the security industry, and you might've already encountered it:</p>
		<p>When it comes to design, most security firms have their sales people designing their systems.</p>
		<p>That doesn't make sense ... it's like asking a web developer to network your computers. A web developer might know quite a bit about computers, but networking's not what they do on a regular basis</p>
	</div>
	<hr class="horizontal-line">
	<div class="design-section">
		<p><b>WHEN YOU WANT A JOB DONE RIGHT, YOU NEED THE RIGHT SPECIALIST.</b></p>
		<p>Look, we love our sales team. They're some of the nicest and most knowledge people you'll ever meet. But sales people are experts in helping you find the right solutions, and putting you in touch with the right experts depending on what you need ... not designing security systems</p>
	</div>
	<hr class="horizontal-line">
	<div class="design-section">
		<p><b>CUSTOM DESIGN BY PROFESSIONAL SECURITY ENGINEERS</b></p>
		<p>With 3Sixty's design service, you'll get a dedicated, certified enterprise security engineer who works directly with you to figure out the best way to accomplish your security objectives, whether it's a new turnkey system or an overhaul of something that's not working as well as it should.</p>
		<p>You'll end up with a 100% customized design proposal based on what you have and what you need to secure, with professional, detailed schematics that you can show your boss and colleagues as part of the decision-making process.</p>

	<hr class="horizontal-line">
	<div class="design-section">
		<p><b>HAVE IT ALL, WITHOUT BUYING IT ALL.</b></p>
		<p>You might not need as much equipment as other security companies might say you do.</p>
		<p>Already have a security system, and just want to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Simplify?</li>
			<li>Integrate systems?</li>
			<li>Add a new feature?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Often, you can combine systems via software instead of ripping everything out and replacing it ... Sometimes you just need an upgrade to part of your system to make it work more reliably and conveniently, with the features you need.</p>
		<p>We'll let you know if you really need to buy that new equipment or not.</p>

		<p><b>A PRICE YOU WON'T BELIEVE</b></p>
